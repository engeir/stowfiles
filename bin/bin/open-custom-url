#!/bin/bash

# Usage
#
# Make this script executable and place it on your PATH, say
# `/$HOME/bin/open-custom-url`. Then, place the following desktop entry somewhere, say
# in `$HOME/.local/share/applications/open-custom-url.desktop`:
#
# [Desktop Entry]
# Version=1.0
# Name=Browser Router
# Exec=/home/local-lafadm/bin/open-custom-url %u
# Terminal=false
# Type=Application
# MimeType=x-scheme-handler/unknown;x-scheme-handler/about;text/html;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;
#
# Finally, run
#
#     xdg-settings set default-web-browser open-custom-url.desktop
#
# from the same directory as the desktop script. Now, all domains that you place inside
# of `$HOME/firefox_domains.txt` will be opened in Firefox, while the rest is opened in
# Vivaldi.
#
# nrk.no
# vg.no
# vivaldi.com

# Path to the text file containing domains to open with Firefox
DOMAIN_FILE_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/open-custom-url"
mkdir -p "$DOMAIN_FILE_PATH"
FIREFOX_DOMAINS_FILE="$DOMAIN_FILE_PATH/firefox_domains.txt"

# Get the URL passed to the script
URL="$1"

# Extract the domain from the URL
DOMAIN=$(echo "$URL" | awk -F[/:] '{print $4}')

# Check if the domain is in the Firefox domains list
if grep -q "$DOMAIN" "$FIREFOX_DOMAINS_FILE"; then
    firefox "$URL" # Open with Firefox
else
    vivaldi "$URL" # Open with Vivaldi (default browser)
