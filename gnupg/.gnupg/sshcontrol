# SSH keys managed by gpg-agent
# List SSH key keygrips here (one per line)
#
# To find the keygrip of an SSH key:
#   ssh-add -L | ssh-keygen -l -f -
#   Then correlate with: gpg-connect-agent 'keyinfo --ssh-list' /bye
#
# Or convert your SSH key and import it:
#   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
#   ssh-add -L > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.tmp
#
# After adding keygrips here, gpg-agent will manage those SSH keys
# When you try to use them, pinentry will prompt for the passphrase
#
# Example format (remove the # to activate):
# KEYGRIP_HERE_40_HEX_CHARS 0
#
# The trailing 0 means no confirmation required
# Use 1 if you want confirmation prompt for each use
